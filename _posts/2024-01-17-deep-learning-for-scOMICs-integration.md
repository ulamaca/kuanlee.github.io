Recently, I've started working on deep learning (especially, autoencoders) to extract things from omics data. 
I've read two papers:
1. 
2. 

The common benchmark datasets are:
```markdown
| x  | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :-----------: | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left 1        |    center 1    |       right 1 |
| Left 2        |    center 2    |       right 2 |
| Left 3        |    center 3    |       right 3 |
```
